# Numerical Methods

In the 4th semester of engineering, I had a paper of Numerical methods. 

[Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation for the problems of mathematical analysis]
(Wikipedia)

This paper was really interesting and I liked studying it.
If some basic concepts are clear , this paper will be very easy and it is very much scoring too.

Back then I made these programs. and practiced my theory concepts.

The programs are very simple and they are based on some basic Numerical concepts .

I would be happy if you could help me in improving the codes.

Do let me know , if there are any issues in the code, I will try to solve them.

Feedbacks are highly appreciated.

Thank You !
